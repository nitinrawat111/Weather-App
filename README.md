# Weather App
This repository contains a very basic weather app made in Vanilla JS. It displays the weather details corresponding to your current IP location. 

This app first fetches your IP address using [IPGeolocation API](https://ipgeolocation.io/) and then uses that IP address to fetch the Weather data pertaining to your current IP location using API provided by [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
